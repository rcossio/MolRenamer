Info)
   - Atom indices must be unique.
   - Atom name must be unique.
   - Conectivity must be correct -except for H atoms- (check visually with Pymol,VMD, etc.).
   - CONECT lines must be after all HETATM lines.
   - The template must contain all the atoms in the query file.
   - This algorithm assigns atom names by their conectivity. It can happen with highly
     simmetric molecules that the script fails to get the right naming. When this happens
     the molecule is not fully translated. Always check with you preferred visualizer.
